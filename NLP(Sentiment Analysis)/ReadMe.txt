In todayâ€™s world, the use of social media has become increasingly popular as a means of communication and information exchange. This has resulted in the emergence of new challenges for businesses that need to be able to understand the sentiment of public opinion about their products, services, and brand.

The objective of this project is to develop a Python pipeline to collect public tweets and use machine learning techniques to analyze the sentiment of these tweets. The pipeline will collect tweets from a variety of sources, including Twitter, and store them in a table. Once collected, the dataset will then be used to analyze the sentiments of the tweets. It will be able to identify the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments of the tweets.

The data gathered from this pipeline will be used to inform businesses of the public opinion on their products and services in general. This will be done by providing a sentiment analysis of the tweets mostly around movies and cinema reviews, allowing businesses to better understand how their products and services are being received by the public. This understanding can be used to help businesses make decisions about the way they communicate with their customers or audience, as well as their overall marketing strategy.

In addition, the data gathered from this pipeline can be used in other ways, such as to identify trends in public opinion. This could be beneficial in helping businesses to better understand how their products and services are being perceived by the public, as well as to identify any areas where improvement is needed.

Finally, the data gathered from this pipeline can also be used in the development of machine learning models. This could be beneficial in helping businesses to better understand the sentiment of public opinion, as well as to identify any potential issues that could arise from the use of their products and services which in this specific topic we fetch tweets around the movies.

Overall, the project will be able to identify the positive, negative, and neutral sentiments of the tweets, and can also be used in the development of machine learning models. This pipeline has the potential to provide businesses with valuable insight into public opinion about their products and services, which can in turn be used to inform their overall marketing strategy.
