Business Problem Understanding:

As a data scientist, it is important to understand the business problem in order to develop a successful solution. In this case, the business problem is to reduce traffic in the city by implementing a bike sharing system. To do this, our data science team must identify the metrics that will have a significant impact on bike sharing. This includes the day of the week, the time of year, and the weather.

Once these metrics have been identified, our team can then use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to develop a model that can make predictions about future bike sharing usage. This model can then be used to improve service management and optimize the bike sharing system.

In addition, I must also recommand to consider the environmental impact of the bike sharing system. This includes understanding the impact of bike sharing on air pollution and the local environment.

By understanding the business problem and the potential implications of the bike sharing system, I as data science team-lead will try to develop a successful solution that can reduce traffic in the city and improve the local community. By utilizing machine learning and deep learning algorithms, we will develop a model that can make predictions about future bike sharing usage and optimize the bike sharing system.
