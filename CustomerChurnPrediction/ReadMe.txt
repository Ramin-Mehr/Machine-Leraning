**CCP (Churn Customer Prediction):**

The chosen dataset from Kaggle is a great resource for predicting customer churn in the telco industry. It contains 7,000 records and 20 features that can be used to analyze customer behavior and identify those at risk of churning. The target feature of the dataset is the "Churn" column which contains either "Yes" or "No" values indicating whether or not the customer has churned. With this dataset, we can apply various Machine Learning algorithms to predict customer churn and develop strategies to retain customers.

Following my experience and career in Telco Industry (MTN-Irancell), prediction on churn and how to increase the revenue of the company with different campaigns and make the customer more loyal is one of the most challenging problems which the baseline of all actions is to know the churn ratio on our products and our customers.

One of the most common algorithms used in this dataset is Decision Tree. Decision Tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used to classify data by building decision trees based on the features of the data. It works by splitting the data into different branches based on the features of the data, such as customer age, contract type, and payment method. This algorithm can be used to predict customer churn by analyzing the different branches of the decision tree and identifying the ones that are more likely to lead to churn. we will test this algorithm beside other ML algorithms to identify is it still a best choice or we could choose other ones considering more metrics.

Different ML classification techniques, including Decision Tree, SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were tested for this aim. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, and using various measurement criteria, we will select one of them and provide our hypothesis.
